## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer with a Master's Degree in Applied Physics, specialized in numerical analysis and computer simulations of physical phenomena.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bettering my skills related to Object-oriented Programming in Python and effective use of Git and GitHub
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Quantum Physics or the Universe (but don't ask about Pluto :\)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tmaciocha95@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Matter is mostly empty space - if you'd compress the mass of an average human (about 80kg) into a ball of densely packed neutrons it would be about the size of a bacteria.
